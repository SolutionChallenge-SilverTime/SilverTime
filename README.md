## Instroduction

SilverTime is a service provided by a welfare center that offers various contents for elderly people. Our service provides classes in various fields such as art, cooking, and sports, allowing elderly people to enjoy a variety of hobbies.

In addition, we offer customized recommendation classes based on the interests entered when signing up, providing more personalized services to elderly people. Our tutors are experts in each field, and after the class, we send specific information about the elderly people to their guardians.

We strive to provide elderly people with a more enjoyable retirement life by helping them find new hobbies. Try our service, and you will have a more fulfilling time.
